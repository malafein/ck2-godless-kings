# Godless Kings #

### What is this repository for? ###

* Godless Kings is a mod for Crusader Kings 2 that adds the option of playing secular / non-religious rulers.
* Version 0.1

* [Available on Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=422474485&searchtext=)

#### Description ####

Godless Kings adds None as a religion for custom game setups. This is still a very 
EARLY WORK IN PROGRESS, so expect some bugs and changes. 

This isn't intended to be historically accurate, but I'll try to keep it somewhat balanced and reasonable. As an atheist myself, I just thought it'd be fun to play as a godless ruler in one of my favorite grand strategy games.

#### Features ####

* None is added as a religion. 
* Secular Liberation is a new casus belli available to rulers with no religion that should be pretty similar to religious wars. 
* A "holy" order, Militant Atheists, is available to rally by expending the ruler's Reason (piety). 
* School buildings that focus on economy, military, or culture are available for construction. 
* Character trait for Closeted Atheist and the ability to renounce religion and become openly secular (converting to None religion). First a cynical character may decide they are atheist. Then they have the option to leave their religion. 

#### Planned Features/Changes ####
* Add some new events
* Add diplomacy interactions to allow converting other characters to and from religion, instead of just always demanding.
* Change the Secular Liberation to work more like crusades, and open up holy war casus belli for None to avoid having to modify any of the default files and be more compatible with other mods. 
* Adjust opinion modifiers to make atheist rulers even less liked than "infidels" and more likely targets of holy wars.
* Add ability for secular rulers to convert to Republic.

Suggestions are welcome. 

Thanks!

### How do I get set up for modding? ###

* Mod files for Crusader Kings 2 will be located in the users or home directory. I prefer to keep a separate copy of the files in a workspace directory.

* Tools I use for editing: Notepad++, Gimp with DDS plugin

* It is probably a good idea to keep the game updated to latest version.

* To test, you'll have to run the game with the mod loaded.  There is also a validator tool available.
